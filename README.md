# Small Scale Galaxy Admins

Galaxy Admins can share documents and code which helped them to run their server in this repository.

However, it is strongly advised to add your SQL code to https://github.com/galaxyproject/gxadmin and your python scripts to https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris and thereby extend the functionality of these existing tools - even just as an issue (if you struggle to make a PR)

### who we are

Our home page: https://galaxyproject.org/projects/small-scale-admins/

Altough, the main target group are Galaxy admins of small scale installations, aka 'non-usegalaxy.*', we welcome any contribution.
